## Features
+ Users are able to click on dates and add tasks to the task list on that particular day
+ Users can specify the time block in which that task will be completed in (eg. from 1-2pm, exercise)
+ When scheduling conflicting events (events on the same date and time) the user will be warned of this conflict, but will have the option to still add the task

**^^^ We can get rid of this last one if we decide on the functionality being different**
