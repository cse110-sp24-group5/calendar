## Github Pages Link
You can access our calendar WebApp here: https://cse110-sp24-group5.github.io/calendar/.

If you would like to see a demo of this, you can checkout the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZNxWUYSLT0).

## Purpose
The main purpose of this calendar application is to boost productivity. It provides users with a convenient and user-friendly way to visualize the days of the month, with a focus on the month of April in 2024. This application aims to simplify the task of keeping track of daily events, appointments, and reminders by offering a comprehensive calendar view.

Users can easily track their tasks by clicking on a specific day by clicking on it, this will then  display a list of tasks scheduled for that particular date. This feature ensures that users can stay organized and never miss an important event or deadline.

## Features

## Linting
Linting is a crucial practice that helps ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the entire codebase. In this project, linting has been set up for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to adhere to industry-standard best practices and coding conventions. HTML linting checks for proper markup structure, CSS linting maintains consistent stylesheet styles, and JavaScript linting catches syntax errors, potential bugs, and performance issues in the application's logic and functionality.

We have implemented automated linting checks performed on every push or pull request to make sure potential issues are caught early in the development process, and make sure that our coding standard is met. When you push changes, on GitHub you will be able to see a tick or cross next to it based on whether it passes that check. You can click on the same to view details. Along with this you can also run the linter locally.

To run all of them: `npm run lint`


To run only the HTML lint: `npm run lint:html`


To run only the CSS lint: `npm run lint:css`


To run only the Javascript lint: `npm run lint:js`


## SWOT Analysis
**Strengths:**

| Strength | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Efficiency** | - Utilized GitHub issues to assign tasks to members and linked pull requests to handle issues |
| **Organization** | - Evenly divided tasks among group members, completed subtasks within self-imposed deadlines |
| **Responsiveness** | - Implemented webpage to adjust layout based on the device the page is loaded on |

**Weaknesses:**

| Weakness | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Lack of Widget features** | - Widget only has the days of April listed, not a year-long calendar yet <br> - No current date tracker |
| **Scheduling Meetings** | - The team as a whole did not have many opportunities to have meetings in person to communicate the progress made so far |

**Opportunities:**

| Opurtunity | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Additional Features** | - Adding all the months to the calendar along with a toggle bar to change the months <br> - Making the Task List more customizable <br> - Allow people to schedule events on the calendar (start and end time) instead of just adding todos <br> - Recurring events on the calendar |
| **Real Implication** | - We got to use HTML, CSS and JS to build a useful application |

**Threats:**

| Threat | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Deadlines** | - Tight turnaround time for all teams to complete their respective subtasks |

## Our Learnings

Applying Labs to a Real-World Application

Throughout this project, we had the opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the course labs to a practical, real-world application. Translating theoretical knowledge into a functional web application helped us truly understand how everything works. We also learned how the development process works, and how different members in a team contribute. 


Effective Use of AI Assistance

During the development process, we learned how to effectively leverage AI assistance tools to enhance our productivity and understand the technologies better.
